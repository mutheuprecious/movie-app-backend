# Seed your database here
# example for the seeding database using an API
#response= RestClient.get "whatever the url is goes here"
# variable_for_the_response=JSON.parse(response)
# once we get the response in JSON we can work with our json data 
# for eg we can do variable_for_the_response["some_attribute"]
# to get the value of that attribute from the json hash
# we can also get the keys using variable_for_the_response.keys
# so our example is as follows let's say we want to get certain values of an hash
# defined by the different paths


# we would need different links for api links in our database seeding
#may be with different tables and models for each category


# let's get all the urls that we will need
